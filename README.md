Example of how to evaluate interpretations of binary variables in a boolean formula represented as a BDD

The BuDDy library for bdd manipulation is super awesome, but evaluating an interpretation of the variables for a particular formula seems kind of clumsy as far as I can tell from the documentation. I wrote this simple function to evaluate the variables in a formula with the restrict operator.
